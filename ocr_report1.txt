Bio. Ref. Interval. :-

Non-Smokers : < 2.50 ng/mL
Smokers —: < 5.00 ng/mL

Clinical Significance :

CEA is often used to monitor patients with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). Increased CEA levels can indicate some
Non-Cancer related conditions, Such as some forms of inflammation, Cirrhosis, and Peptic Ulcer. Also, Smokers tend to have
Higher CEA levels than Non-Smokers. When cancer spreads to other organs, CEA levels rise and may be present in other types of

bodily fluids besides blood.

For Diagnostic Purpose, Results should always be assessed in Conjunction with the patients medical history, clinical examination
and other findings.

Bio. Ref. Interval. :
Deficiency : <=20 ng/ml || Insufficiency : 21-29 ng/ml
Sufficiency : >= 30 ng/ml || Toxicity : >100 ng/ml

Clinical Significance:

Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that has been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorous; both are critical for building
bone health.

Decrease in vitamin D total levels indicate inadequate exposure of sunlight, dietary deficiency, nephrotic syndrome.

Increase in vitamin D total levels indicate Vitamin D intoxication.

VITAMIN B-12 E.C.L.I.A 470 pg/mL

Bio. Ref. Interval. :
Normal: 197-771 pg/ml

Clinical significance :

Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin, is a complex corrinoid compound found exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat, eggs and milk. It
is critical in normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation and in the formation of myelin sheath. Vitamin-B12 is used to find
out neurological abnormalities and impaired DNA synthesis associated with macrocytic anemias. For diagnostic purpose, results should always be
assessed in conjunction with the patients medical history, clinical examination and other findings.

Elevated levels of PSA are associated with prostate cancer, but may also be seen with prostatitis (Inflammation of the prostate)
and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PSA test done along with free PSA provides additional information. Studies have
suggested that the percentage of free PSA in total PSA is lower in patients with prostate cancer than those with benign prostate
hyperplasia.

Specification:

Precision: Intra assay (%CV): 4.38%, Inter assay (%CV): 4.67%; Sensitivity: 0.01 ng/ml

MAGNESIUM PHOTOMETRY 1.95 mg/dL

Bio. Ref. Interval. :-

1.90 - 3.10 mg/dL
Clinical significance:

Magnesium is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and second most prevalent intracellular cation. The total body
magnesium content is about 25 g or approximately 1 mol, of which 55% reside in the skeleton. About 45% of the magnesium is
intracellular. In general higher the metabolic activity of cell, the greater is its magnesium content. Magnesium is a cofactor for
more than 300 enzymes in the body.

Disorders of magnesium metabolism are separated into those causing hypomagnesaemia/magnesium deficiencies and
hypermagnesemia. Hypomagnesaemia is common in patient in hospitals. Moderate to severe deficiency of magnesium is usually
due to loss of magnesium from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract or kidneys. One of the more serious complications of magnesium
deficiency is cardiac arrhythmia. Symptomatic hypermagnsemia is almost always caused by excessive intake, resulting from
administration of antacids, enemas, and parenteral fluids containing magnesium. Depression of neuromuscular system is the most
common manifestation of magnesium intoxication.

Clinical Significance :

An increased level of blood chloride (called hyperchloremia) usually indicates dehydration, but can also occur with other problems that cause high
blood sodium, such as Cushing syndrome or kidney disease. Hyperchloremia also occurs when too much base is lost from the body (producing
metabolic acidosis) or when a person hyperventilates (causing respiratory alkalosis). A decreased level of blood chloride (called hypochloremia)
occurs with any disorder that causes low blood sodium. Hypochloremia also occurs with congestive heart failure, prolonged vomiting or gastric
suction, Addison disease, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases (causing respiratory acidosis), and with loss of acid from the body (called
metabolic alkalosis).

EST. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (eGFR) CALCULATED 61 mL/min/1.73 m2

> = 90 : Normal
60 - 89: Mild Decrease
45-59 : Mild to Moderate Decrease

30-44 : Moderate to Severe Decrease
15-29 : Severe Decrease

Clinical Significance

The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild and
moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely
estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value
when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in
clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to
interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the
percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal
medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.

Remarks: Alert!!! Predominantly normocytic normochromic with ovalocytes. Platelets: Appear adequate in smear.

Clinical history is asked for all the relevant abnormalities detected and in absence / failure of receiving of clinical history,
results are rechecked twice and released. Advised clinical correlation.
Method : Fully automated bidirectional analyser (6 Part Differential SYSMEX XN-1000)
(Reference : *FC- flowcytometry, *HF- hydrodynamic focussing, *EI- Electric Impedence, *Hb- hemoglobin, *CPH- Cumulative pulse height)
